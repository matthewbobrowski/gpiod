This is a temporary WIP repository which contains the source code for
the libgpiod GNU/Linux client/daemon programs. Once this project has
been reviewed and is considered mature enough, the idea is to have it
merged into to core libgpiod repository.

The primary idea behind this project is to develop a lightweight
GNU/Linux daemon that has the ability to maintain GPIO line states and
function as the central GPIO authority. This daemon is to be primarily
controlled by a client program utility called gpioctl.

Found a bug in the code? Great, how about we squash it! Feel free to
reach out to a project author detailing what the bug is and the steps
to reproduce the bug and the authors will squash it on your
behalf. Alternatively, you can also send through a patch to one of the
authors detailing the same, but remembering to also include details on
how the patch addresses the identified issue.

Interested in contributing? Fantastic, an extra set of hands can
always be put to good use! The root of this project contains a file
named TODO which outlines some of the outstanding TODO items. Feel
free to pick up and take on one of those items. Before doing so, it
might be a good idea to let one of the project authors know so that
nobody treads on each others feet.
