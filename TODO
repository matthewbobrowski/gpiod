There is a lot to do here, but slowly we'll get there. Use this
document as a reference point if you're interested in picking up some
of the tasks and wanting to offer a helping hand. Before doing
absolutely anything, ensure to reach out to one of the project authors
and give them a heads up on what you're intending to pick up. At
times, you may find that someone has already started a piece of work
and the last thing you want to do is unnecessarily double up on work.
